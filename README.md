## About The Project

### The Problem
The Problem: BrainTrain focuses on assisting to solving the education crisis plaguing areas in the world. 
* Many people around the world suffer from a lack of quality education
* Causing a limitiation in creativity and ingenuity

### The Solution
Our Solution:
BrainTrain is a web-based application based on the 2001 game "Brain Age 2". The application consists of multiple activities intended to stimulate different areas of the brain. Activities range from word-match to addition/subtraction speed runs, mini-sudoku, and many more. The intention is to provide users all-alike with an application that allows the ability to build proficiency in basic mental skills, such as arithmetic, memorization, etc...
